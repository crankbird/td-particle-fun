# Particle Systems in TouchDesigner with GLSL

This project is a learning exercise to build simple particle systems in TouchDesigner using GLSL shaders. Inspired by Daniel Shiffman's "The Nature of Code" examples.

## Structure
- `shaders/` â€” GLSL fragment shaders for particles
- TouchDesigner project files and notes

## Getting Started
1. Open TouchDesigner and create a new project.
2. Add a GLSL TOP and link it to a `.frag` shader from the `shaders/` directory.
3. Experiment and iterate!
